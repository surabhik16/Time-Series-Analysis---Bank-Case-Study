Time Series Analysis- Bank Case Study 

Project Link: http://rpubs.com/surabhik16/bankcasestudy

Time series analysis comprises methods for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data. Time series forecasting is the use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values of the same component.

In this project, We have a time series data of the monthly volume of commercial bank real-estate loans, in billions of dollars, from January 1973 to October 1978, a total of 70 observations.

The data is as follows:

46.5 47.0 47.5 48.3 49.1 50.1 51.1 52.0 53.2 53.9 54.5 55.2 55.6 55.7 

56.1 56.8 57.5 58.3 58.9 59.4 59.8 60.0 60.0 60.3 60.1 59.7 59.5 59.4 

59.3 59.2 59.1 59.0 59.3 59.5 59.5 59.5 59.7 59.7 60.5 60.7 61.3 61.4 

61.8 62.4 62.4 62.9 63.2 63.4 63.9 64.5 65.0 65.4 66.3 67.7 69.0 70.0 

71.4 72.5 73.4 74.6 75.2 75.9 76.8 77.9 79.2 80.5 82.6 84.4 85.9 87.6

We will perform the following steps in order to analyze the data and make predictions:
STEP 1 : IMPORTING THE CODE

STEP 2: MODEL ESTIMATION

STEP 3 : TESTS FOR STATIONARITY

STEP 4: PARAMETER ESTIMATION

STEP 5 : FITTED VALUES

STEP 6 : RESIDUAL ANALYSIS

STEP 7 : FORECASTING
